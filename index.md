## What is Cloud-Native?

According to the [Linux Foundation](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/master/charter.md#1-mission-of-the-cloud-native-computing-foundation):
> “Cloud native technologies empower organizations to build and run scalable applications in modern, dynamic environments such as public, private, and hybrid clouds. Containers, service meshes, microservices, immutable infrastructure, and declarative APIs exemplify this approach.”

Although there is no consensus of its definition, we can outline that Cloud Native is a development and deployment methodology, in which applications are built as microservices and orchestrated as containers to take advantage of the cloud computing model. The term Cloud can be confusing as some may assume the strict necessity to deploy this type of software in a Cloud Provider, but as a matter of fact, the **where** question is not the most relevant, although many organizations will aim to do so.  If the applications are designed as loosely coupled systems, optimized for scalability and performance and managed through container orchestration, they are cloud-native.
